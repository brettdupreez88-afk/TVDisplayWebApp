Light, approachable, and effortlessly refreshing, this Summer Ale is brewed to capture the essence of warm days and easy living. Pale gold in colour with brilliant clarity, it pours with a soft, white head and an inviting aroma of fresh grain, subtle citrus, and delicate floral hops.

The flavour profile is clean and balanced, showcasing mild malt sweetness reminiscent of freshly baked bread, followed by gentle notes of lemon, orange blossom, and a hint of grassiness from carefully selected hops. Low bitterness keeps the beer smooth and sessionable, while a crisp carbonation enhances its refreshing character.

Designed for drinkability, this ale finishes clean and dry, making it an ideal companion for outdoor lunches, barbecues, and long afternoons in the sun. It pairs beautifully with light seafood, grilled chicken, salads, and soft cheeses. Unpretentious yet well-crafted, this Summer Ale delivers flavour without heaviness—an easygoing beer that celebrates simplicity, balance, and pure refreshment.
