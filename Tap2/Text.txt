Bold, aromatic, and full-bodied, this Indian Pale Ale is a showcase of hop-forward intensity and layered complexity. Deep golden to amber in appearance, it releases an expressive bouquet of tropical fruit, citrus peel, pine resin, and subtle herbal notes the moment it hits the glass.

The palate is rich and assertive, led by vibrant hop flavours of grapefruit, mango, passionfruit, and orange zest, supported by a firm malt backbone that adds body and balance. Caramel and toasted malt notes provide depth, preventing the bitterness from becoming sharp while allowing the hops to shine with clarity and purpose.

The bitterness is confident yet refined, building steadily and finishing long and dry, with lingering citrus and resinous notes that define the style. This IPA is both powerful and nuanced—rewarding slow sipping while remaining dangerously drinkable. Ideal for hop lovers, it pairs exceptionally well with spicy foods, strong cheeses, grilled meats, and bold flavours. A modern classic that delivers intensity, balance, and unmistakable character in every pour.
